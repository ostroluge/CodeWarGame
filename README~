Codewar is developped by wadinj and ostrowst for a coding project at Lille 1 University. 
It's a game for coders, which is based on emulating microprocessors, and make them "fight" on a grid.

In file called "Processeur" you find one processor emulated with all instructions.
In main file you can find the game.

For compilation, if you want to run CodeWar, type make on main directory.
If you want to run one processor, type make in "Processor"
Enjoy.
